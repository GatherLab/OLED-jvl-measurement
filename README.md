# OLED-jvl-measurement

Tested on Arch Linux with Python 3.8.6

## Introduction

An easy to use tool to facilitate OLED characterisation using a fixed distance measurement setup as well as a goniometer for angle resolved EQE measurements.

## Requirements

Formatting happens with black python formatter. Any changes to the code should be formatted accordingly.
Please find all the package requirements in requirements.txt. I recommend using a virtual environment management tool like venv together with pip or anaconda to install the packages within a virtual environment using

```terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute the jvl_measurement.py file which is the main file e.g. with

```terminal
python3 jvl_measurement.py
```

The others are only dependencies.

Furthermore, the apt.dll driver (https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=9019) must be installed as well as the libusb-1.0.lib driver for detecting usb hardware: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33972145/pyusb-on-windows-8-1-no-backend-available-how-to-install-libusb.

Install NI-visa from website https://www.ni.com/de-de/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-visa.html#346210
Install Keithley driver from website: https://de.tek.com/source-measure-units/2450-software-6 (prerequisit: NI-visa)

Furthermore, the command set in the Keithley source has to be set to SCPI

## User Journey

### Setup (Current Tester)

Here the basic information about the measured batch must be provided that are

- The folder path used to save the measured data and the configuration files (with measurement parameters)
- A short name that characterises the batch well
- The device number of the currently measured device

After these parameters are set (that are valid globally over the entire program) a current testing can be done to test which pixels of the OLED work. The idea is to just select pixels on the left side (multiple pixels can be selected by clicking on them). The additional options given shall facilitate the testing. Those are

- select all pixels
- unselect all pixels
- pre-bias all pixels (to a predefined bias as e.g. - 2 V)
- auto test all pixels. I don't know yet exactly how to implement this but one could, for instance, simply think about a current threshold that must be reached at a certain predefined voltage. If it isn't the pixel is defined as not working.

The current reading can be seen on the large LCD style widget next to the pixel selection. This is not really necessary since it can also be read from the Keithley of course but may facilitate operation.

The option below allows to change the voltage to test the pixels provided over the Keithley.

Below that the user is asked to provide some short of brief documentation of the batch for easier tracking of what is going on. I was thinking of comments like:

- "OLED configuration: Ag - MoO3 - SpiroTTB + F6TCNNQ - NPB - MADN + TBPe - Balq - Bphen + CsO - Ag"
- "Most devices do not work possibly due to ..."
- "[!] The software always returns an error when measuring pixel 8 possibly due to ..."

This shall be optional but may facilitate future error tracking and improvement of the software as well as tracking down problems with the OLEDs or the sample holder.

### Autotube JVL

Measurement parameters can be selected on the right side. Pixels that worked in the Setup section are automatically selected. The user still has the possibility to exclude those pixels. The measurement is started using the "Start Measurement" button. A progress bar in the bottom status bar shows the progress of the measurement. The measured current and PD voltage are plotted directly on the center graph. Any problem messages are displayed in the bottom statusbar (that by default say "Ready")

### Spectrum

Tab to measure spectrum of an OLED pixel. It is unclear if this can be easily done to me, since I don't know about the api of the spectrum. Should, however, in principle be possible because it is probably also used for the goniometer measurements. The idea is to simply allow the user to measure the spectrum from the program as well instead of changing to the OceanView software. This could then be even combined with a direct calculation of the performance parameters if a spectrum was already measured. If it wasn't the autotube JVL just shows the current and photodiode voltage.

For the measurement the user only has to provide the pixel that shall be measured and the voltage that shall be applied for the measurement. One could also think about a seperate background measurement button but we could also make the separate measurement of a background spectrum obsolete by turning the OLED off automatically after the measurement was done and then subtract the spectrum automatically.

### Goniometer

Current motor/stage position is displayed visually on the top right including a angle reading. The offset angle can be changed manually for sample adjustment (by explicitly clicking on the move button to prevent unwanted movements).
If the sample is setup in the goniometer setup, the scanning parameters including the overall scanning angle (starting from 0Â°) can be entered. Additional options to do a PL instead of an EL measurement as well as entering a constant current instead of a constant voltage are provided.

Are there any specific parameters that should only be provided for EL/PL measurements?

Again the pixel of interest can be selected. However, only one because only one can be measured at once. The measurement can be started using a start measurement button.

The progress of the measurement can be seen via the progress bar in the status bar, on the plot on the left (the nature of which is not clearly defined yet) or by looking at the current stage position at the top.

### Additional/Global Settings

In the top menubar there is are two options:

- File
  - Load Measurement Parameters
  - Save Measurement Parameters
- Settings
  - Options
  - Help
  - Open Log

The idea is that measurement parameters can be saved and loaded for later measurements and so that not all the parameters have to be entered again all the time (although standard parameters shall be provided).

The settings tab is not yet clearly defined although it shall link to the documentation of the software (via Help) and allow to open the log file that logs possible errors occurring with the program. I don't know yet what the options tab contains but this might contain some global options that are only seldomly touched. If it is not necessary after all we can just delete it.

#### Parameters for global settings

- Keithley and arduino addresses
- photodiode gain

## Documentation

### Arduino Communication

Our setup uses an arduino only to select the pixels of a device that shall be measured. Arduino-Python communication does not seem trivial. An easy way to circumvent the problem is to design the Arduino sketch in such a manner that we can communicate with it via serial communication. If the arduino is connected to the PC python can use the same channel to communicate with the Arduino. Predefined commands that we can also enter manually can now be sent using a python script and the serial package for python.
